'''Details of the project - This is a python project that takes the item you want to search on flipkart as input generates and 
prints the URL of that product. Then makes a .csv file of the same name as the input.This file has the headings- Product_Name, Pricing, Ratings
with the entities of flipkart's first page below it. Note- In case you want to verify if what was parsed is correct by opening the URL
use incognito browser so your cache and your history doesn't affect the findings of the page.
